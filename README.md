# Ask-Me

# Introduction
AskMe is an anonymous question and answer platform designed to cater to individuals who may be hesitant or not socially active in expressing their queries publicly. Built with the Django framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for posting questions anonymously and receiving answers from the community. The tech stack includes Django for backend development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, creating a seamless and interactive user experience. With AskMe, users can confidently seek information without revealing their identity, fostering a safe and inclusive space for knowledge-sharing and community engagement.
